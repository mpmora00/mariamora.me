        <h2>Artworks</h2>

        <div style="width:90%"> <p> A series of various original artworks including paintings, sculptures, and drawings, created over the years. I've received drawing and paintings lessons since the age of 3 allowing me to have a large artwork collection. I've only shown the ones I'm most proud but, fortunately, there are more to see.<p></div>
